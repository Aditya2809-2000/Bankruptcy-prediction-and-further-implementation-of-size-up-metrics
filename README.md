# Bankruptcy prediction using big data techniques

Predicting corporate bankruptcy is of paramount importance, leading to the adoption of big data techniques. This research strategically employs machine learning models on datasets from American and Taiwanese companies, drawing from over 5,000 firms' financial statements. The study is contextualized by the 2008 housing market collapse, affecting both regions. Beyond methodological contributions, this research offers cross-country insights. Visualizations like heat maps and box plots guide the analysis. Rigorous pre-processing includes hyperparameter tuning, SMOTE for imbalance, and PCA for dimensionality reduction. Performance metrics like Speedups, Scaleups, and Sizeups ensure model scalability with large datasets. Evaluation metrics include F1 score and ROC-AUC, supplemented by detailed classification reports. This work not only advances bankruptcy prediction through a holistic approach but also enriches understanding across different economies, aiding financial risk assessment and decision-making.
